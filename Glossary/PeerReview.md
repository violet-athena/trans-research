# Peer Review

Peer review is a term often used maliciously by GCs and other bad faith actors to lend credibility to studies they cite or to imply that their claim about the studies is valid.

This is often not true and it stems from misunderstanding what the term means, or from the hope that the other side won't understand what the term means.

## What is Peer Review

Peer review is simply the evaluation of work by one or more people with similar competencies in order to ensure that it doesn't lie outside the boundaries of the field.

## What Peer Review isn't

Peer review is not a guarantor of validity or truthfulness. The purpose of the review is to establish that the work fits with the rest of the field.

*For example*, a carpenter's work can be evaluated by another carpenter to see if it fits with the standards of the profession since an untrained eye may miss issues with it. This doesn't constitute a value judgement of the work though. Ultimately only the customer of the original carpenter can decide weather they like it or not.

This is similar in scientific circles where Peer review is performed to ensure that the methods used in a study are scientifically valid and appropriate for that field.

It's important to note that a study that passes Peer review can still have a wrong conclusion and one that doesn't can still have a right one.

***Example 1:**
Merry submits a study that finds that red apples are considered sweeter. Her statistical method is correct, her sample size is large enough, she controlled for various factors. Her study passes peer review. Some time later, another study using different statistical method finds that not to be the case and then more and more studies come out that have similar outcomes to the latter one. Merry's study is ultimately wrong, despite passing peer review and being conducted correctly and in good faith.*

***Example 2:**
James submits a study that claims that Dutch people are the tallest in Europe. Other studies concur. James' study, however, doesn't pass peer review since it was determined that he bases those claims just by recording the hight of Dutch people from one specific region and extrapolated for the rest of the country based on a controversial statistical model that was never used in this type of study. Although the conclusion is true, the way it was arrived at was not good enough to pass Peer review.*

# Is Peer review only used for science and scientific papers?

No. Peer review can be used for anything and often is. Code is usually peer reviewed by other programmers before it can be accepted for production. Mechanical engineers often inspect each other's work for flaws and issues. In a scientific context, often times things that are not scientific papers are submitted to journals for peer review. This can include guidelines, methodology, recommendations, etc.

Something that is often cited by GCs as a "peer reviewed study proving sex based differences" is [this statement](https://academic.oup.com/edrv/article/42/3/219/6159361?login=true) by the Endocrine Society. The claim is that because it's peer reviewed it's proof that males and females are different and thus trans women would be considered male by science.

Leaving aside that this is not what the document says, it is important to note that the claim it is Peer reviewed is true.

What is not true is that this is a study, it is not. It is a statement by the society and a recommendation that gender and sex be considered separately when doing research because lumping them together skews the data.

In this context, the Peer review ensures that the basis for the recommendation is scientifically consistent with the field and doesn't establish the truthfulness of the content, nor does it agree with the statement.
