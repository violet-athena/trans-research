# Can formerly pregnant women donate blood to AMABs

There's this assertion floating in GC spaces that women that used to be pregnant can only donate blood to people assigned female at birth. This claim is based on a Dutch [study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2657356) covering donor and recipient records from Sweden, Denmark, Netherlands, and Canada.

## Summary of the claim

The claim is that once a woman undergoes pregnancy, her blood becomes only viable for assigned female at birth people and this shows categorical differences between AFABs & AMABs.

For the purposes of this document, all philosophical arguments following from this assertion will be ignored and it will focus only on the scientific validity of the initial claim.

## What does the study say

The original study claims that based on donor/recipient information of 42,132 patients, it appears that male patients receiving blood from women that used to be pregnant (ever-pregnant), experienced 13% higher mortality compared to those that received blood from women that were never-pregnant.

It also notes that the mortality is observed even one year after the procedure.

It warns that there was no control for amount of transfusions which is important, because more transfusions may indicate more serious conditions.

If the control and the use of other statistical methods still show increased mortality, it proposes a mechanism related to yet to be established permanent changes in the immune system of those that underwent pregnancy. That no increased mortality is observed in female recipients is indicative that sex may play some role, but the study is unsure what. One proposed mechanism is that this is related to the Y chromosome, but it notes that **this is highly unlikely** since age is also a significant factor. A second proposed mechanism is related to androgens and their effect on the body.

## What the study doesn't say

Despite the original claim, it doesn't appear that those assigned male at birth are unable to receive blood donations from those assigned female at birth.

In the majority of cases everything appeared to be fine and the result was statistically significant only in certain age groups. This can indicate either faulty analysis or mechanism related to androgens (hormones) and not sex assigned at birth.

Importantly, the study did not account for gender identity and we don't know what the effects were on those that undergo HRT treatment. If the effect is real and the hormonal mechanism proposed in the study is responsible for the observation, this would mean that trans women undergoing hormonal therapy would probably fall outside the male group in the study.

The study also doesn't clarify how did they get the male/female distinction. It appears that's based on medical records and those are aligned with gender identity in the selected countries where the data was taken from.

## What other studies say

Another [study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2735501), based on larger sample sizes, show no increased risk of mortality in male recipients of blood donated from ever-pregnant women.

Other methodological issues with the original study are pointed in this [pop article](https://www.statnews.com/2017/10/17/blood-transfusions-pregnant-women/) by [Sharon Begley](https://twitter.com/sxbegle).

She points out that they tested a lot of different pairings and only statistically significant pairing was for males under 50. This is a red flag, she points, as you are supposed to adjust your math to prevent those type of things popping at random. This almost disqualified the study from being published but was allowed since the authors recognise this as a problem and encourage others to use different statistical models.

## Medical community reception

The medical community is investigating this, but feels that the study is not enough to prompt any changes in donor protocols since conflicting studies exist. This is shown in this [WebMD article](https://www.webmd.com/men/news/20171017/is-blood-donated-by-mothers-less-safe-for-men).

## Conclusion

One study showed that donation of blood from ever-pregnant women to male recipients under the age of 50 points to increased mortality rate. The study uses suspect statistical methods, as admitted by the authors and is contradicted by other studies. Based on that, the medical community **does not** consider this to be a settled matter and does not recommend changes to donation guidelines.

Even if such correlation did exist, one of the two proposed mechanisms, the one deemed **more likely**, is *hormone* and not *genetics* based and will therefore class trans women, especially those that underwent female puberty along with the female, not the male group.
