# The Athena's Trans Research repository

This repository aims to set research principles and guidelines for doing crowdsourced research around trans issues. It's also a storage place for all research done by members.

## Principles

1. Selectiveness. It's important to select relevant topics and skip things that are already known.
2. Comprehensiveness. Documents must be complete and contain all relevent data to cover the meaning.
3. Accuracy. As far as possible it must be free from errors and inconsistancies.
4. Objectivity. Documents must be free from personal bias, i.e., they must be free from oneâ€™s personal liking and disliking. The facts must be stated boldly. They must reveal the bitter truth.
5. Clarity. Documents must reveal the facts clearly. Contents and conclusions drawn must be free from ambiguities. In short, outcomes must convey clear-cut implications.
6. Simplicity. Documents must be simple to understand. Unnecessary technical words or terminologies (jargons) should be avoided.
