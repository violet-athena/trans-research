# The Trans Research Vault

This repository aims to set research principles and guidelines for doing crowdsourced research around trans issues. It's also a storage place for all research done by members.

## Principles

1. Selectiveness. It's important to select relevant topics and skip things that are already known.
2. Comprehensiveness. Documents must be complete and contain all relevant data to cover the meaning.
3. Accuracy. As far as possible it must be free from errors and inconsistencies.
4. Objectivity. Documents must be free from personal bias, i.e., they must be free from oneâ€™s personal liking and disliking. The facts must be stated boldly. They must reveal the bitter truth.
5. Clarity. Documents must reveal the facts clearly. Contents and conclusions drawn must be free from ambiguities. In short, outcomes must convey clear-cut implications.
6. Simplicity. Documents must be simple to understand. Unnecessary technical words or terminologies (jargons) should be avoided.

## Contributions guide
1. All changes should be structured as a single commit.
2. Commit subject should be brief and describe the action in simple present tense
3. Commit description should include detailed summary of the changes
